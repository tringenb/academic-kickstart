abstract: "Online child exploitation crimes have evolved over the past few years to include a wide array of concerns including sextortion, deep fakes, sexual solicitation, and live-streamed abuse. NLP research in understanding these chats is crucial, as law enforcement agencies have become overwhelmed with online cases; automated systems are needed in sort through the available textual data and transcripts to improve case triage through identification of criminal activity. In the past, automatic systems have been developed for classifying typologies of child exploitation, predicting level of risk throughout a conversation, and flagging predatory conversations.

While the potential of NLP in the child exploitation domain is substantial, the corpora used to train these models is not always adequate. The data used to train algorithms rely on internet sting operations between a suspected adult abuser and a law enforcement officer (LEO), or adult vigilante, impersonating a minor. Psychology research, which serves as the foundation for theory in the child exploitation domain, suggests internet sting operations progress differently than traditional conversations in which an adult seeks to exploit a minor.

In this talk, I will discuss the evolving nature and impact of child grooming datasets in a hybrid online-offline environment. I will discuss differences which exist in these datasets at various levels of granularity including conversation, grooming stages, and grooming strategy level as well as the impact of these differences on automated triage systems.
